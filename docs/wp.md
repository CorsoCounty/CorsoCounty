CorsoCoin
CorsoCoin is the next evolution on top of LP provision, different from staking as yield is received in a non-restrictive way. This is achieved through the trade tax on any given trade order and relative to the quantity traded a portion is reflected back to token holders directly increasing our holder's balance. While the other half of the fees are liquidated and injected into the locked liquidity pair perpetually raising the price floor of the token and negating increased volatilty over time.
CORSO trade fees are low and for good reason. We tax 4% on all trades, 2% each way to both token holders and the locked LP pair. How we do this;
I.	Split the contract balance into two halves at undisclosed intervals
II.	Assert the contract starting balance, capturing only the BNB that the swaps create
III.	Add those two quantities as liqiduity into the primary CORSO-BNB pool
All performed through the 'swapAndLiquify' function within the token contract atonamously.
Why have we kept fees low?
Our County of protocols for CORSO holders has planned for it a multitude of DeFi tool implementations that require us to keep the trading fees that are hard coded into CORSO to remain low. This lowers reflected and injected amounts due to a lower fee than other reflection tokens out there but lowers the ease of whale accumulation while also allowing for non-instrusive staking. Security is the first concern for us all and external staking contracts for some crypto enthuasists is too risky a play and as such, to accomodate all, this is our plan.
Tokenomics!
⦁	100,000,000,000 Total Supply
⦁	Initial LP Burn = 30,000,000,000
⦁	kennel supply = 21,000,000,000 = // staking contract initial quanitity
⦁	community = 7,350,000,000 // airdrops, competitions, giveaways, events
⦁	dev/marketing = 13,650,000,000 = // vested over 2 years to fund marketing and development
Contract Control?
We are going to retain control of the CorsoCoin contract initially to allows holders to vote to change the way the contract logic works such as tax fees etc before we relinquish complete control. In order to become decentralized, you must first have a little centralisation. But we will renounce contract ownership to our holder as soon as we comfortably can without worry of letting down holders.
The difference with us?
Our initial supply will be cut by 30% immediately and then the staking allowance will be stored in a multisig wallet (that will collect fees, yes) until the staking protocol is deployed at which point the multisig will transfer the entire amount into the contract for distribution to stakers of our Governance token! So, essentially 60% is off the table right away that lowers reflection rates for large holders as the two largest holders will be the burn address (our comfort-blanket price floor rises) and the staking rewards pools(increases initial rewards from staking when staking is deployed vs static 30% reward pool). Both the burn address and staking reward address will increase in unison with each other, so the more volatility and trades that occur in the lead up to staking beginning, the better.
	This spreads the otherwise unfair advantage of early investor vs late investor. The trouble with typical you-know-what forks is that the early investors can scoop up huge portions of tokens and reap a much higher percentage of reflections as opposed to smaller holders. One, could buy more and out-quantity them but we are tired of those dick swinging whales! Because CORSO tokens will be more distributed more smoothly and more fairly it improves returns for holders later in the game.
	 Of course, early adoption MUST and, trust me it does, come with some preferencial treatment. Be it in the form of additional tokens and/or a future airdrop or perhaps an NFT release, there are incentives as always to be one of the first. This is as fair a launch as it gets when it comes to reflection based tokens as previous models have been deemed ponzi-nomics, well that stops here!
CANE 
Our Governance system is as traditional a governance system as they come on the blockchain. It is composed of vetted and audited smart contracts so requires no such audit, but will receive one anyway.

The contract allows for the delegation of voting power to addresses other than your own. This allows for community members to build a rapport and become trusted within the CorsoCounty community. As per our roadmap, we intend on offering a permanent seat at the table to X amount of community members to fulfill roles within the project.
These people will deliver content for events, competitions scheduled by us and we will collate all entries over all competitions and will allow our holders to vote through governance for which member of the community they feel would best compliment our goals and provide the most value, in YOUR eyes as a community member. (The approach may be revisited but this is a primary goal of ours!)
It also allows for the eventual transition into a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). This is true renouncement of ownership and gives 100% control of the entire County to the community via governance! In order to get here, we must build the walls that'll surround this County!
CorsoCounty Governance Token Farming
CANE will be farmed from our primary staking protocol CANE-Kennel. It will require the manual staking and lock-up of CORSO in order in order to distribute your allocated yield for the duration spent staking. This will be the second deployed Kennel after the CORSO-Kennel
By making the holder stake their CORSO in order to receive CANE, we reduce sell pressure. Backed with the reduced sell pressure from the CORSO-CORSO pool. In theory, mostly buy orders are pushed into the LP pair which increases BNB > CORSO ratio within the pool. Which when met with the swapAndLiquifiy function that is called intermitently increases the overall BNB:CORSO pool ratio which is our objective.
	This has a direct increased impact on reducing the price impact of sell orders when they are placed within the pool. We are trying to ensure that over time whether first or late to the party, you have as equal an opportunity as any one else.
