CorsoCounty Whitepaper


The Vision
Reflection based auto-liqudity provision tokens are different from staking as yield is received in a non-restrictive way. This is achieved through the trade tax on any given trade order and relative to the quantity traded a portion is reflected back to token holders directly increasing our holder's balance. While the other half of the fees are liquidated and injected into the locked liquidity pair perpetually raising the price floor of the token and negating increased volatilty over time.
We have plans to experiment heavily with this token policy. Our initial creation being our two protocol eco-system of "Buy, Sell, Burn, Reward". What this translates to in a nutshell is when Buy/Sells are made, a portion of the fees gathered are forever burned and the other is distributed to holders and to the staking contract that we have dubbed "CorsoKennel". Because this protocol releases tokens gradually and it acts as a temporary lock up of tokens and to farm in this with this protocol you must stake CORSO, further locking up supply! This is a stepping stone into a wider and more interconnected suite of DeFi tools.
Cane our Governance token is an experimental Gov token with similar attributes as CORSO such as auto-liquidity provision and holder reflection however, there will be far fewer CANE and a higher liquidity fee. The reflection fee will remain unchanged at 2% but a higher LP-take will solidify the price floor far more effectively increasing it's inherit value on-top of community governance. 

On the matter of community, we aspire to really get the community involved with us at CorsoCounty as the Crypto community is by far the most loyal, engaged and passionate crowdfolk in any industry or sector! We are always searching for gems and shooting for the moons, but forget about the stars around us! We plan on hosting community driven artistic competitions(to name one plan) to showcase our community's talent and allow the chosen winner via governance to help the team in a more full on sense if that's what the individual would like! We have many plans but, one must walk to the dog before it can do its business.

CORSO COIN
CORSO trade fees are low and for good reason. We tax 4% on all trades, 2% each way to both token holders and the locked LP pair. How we do this;
I.	Split the contract balance into two halves at undisclosed intervals
II.	Assert the contract starting balance, capturing only the BNB that the swaps create
III.	Add those two quantities as liqiduity into the primary CORSO-BNB pool
All performed through the 'swapAndLiquify' function within the token contract autonomously and atomically.

Why have we kept fees low?
Our County of protocols for CORSO holders has planned for it a multitude of DeFi tool implementations that require us to keep the trading fees that are hard coded into CORSO to remain low. This lowers reflected and injected amounts due to a lower fee than other reflection tokens out there but lowers the ease of whale accumulation while also allowing for non-instrusive staking. Security is the first concern for us all and external staking contracts for some crypto enthuasists is too risky a play and as such, to accomodate all, this is our plan. Although because we are not releasing contract control until after staking is running flawlessly, the community can decide to change the Tax structure of CORSO if they choose, but ONLY before we release control of the contract.

Tokenomics!
Total Supply : 100,000,000,000 (100 Billion)
Initial Burn : 30,000,000,000 (30 Billion(70B))
CorsoKennel: 30,000,000,000 (30 Billion(40B))
Community Fund: 10,000,000,000 (10 Billion(30B))
Marketing Fund: 10,000,000,000 (10 Billion(20B))
Team/Dev: 20,000,000,000 (20 Billion)

Contract Control?
We are going to retain control of the CorsoCoin contract initially to allows holders to vote to change the way the contract logic works such as tax fees etc before we relinquish complete control. In order to become decentralized, you must first have a little centralization. But we will renounce contract ownership to our holders as soon as we comfortably can without worry of immutable actions being unrevertable, as all blockchain transactions are. 

The difference with us?
Our initial supply will be cut by 30% immediately. And then the staking allowance of CORSO will be locked (that will collect fees, yes) until the staking protocol is deployed at which point farming for CORSO will begin. Essentially 60% is off the table right away that lowers reflection rates for large holders as the two largest holders will be the burn address (our comfort-blanket price floor) and the staking rewards pools(increases initial rewards from staking when staking is deployed vs static 30% supply reward pool). Both the burn address and staking reward address will increase in unison with each other, so the more volatility and trades that occur in the lead up to staking beginning, the better.
	This spreads the otherwise unfair advantage of early investor vs late investor. The trouble with typical you-know-what forks is that the early investors can scoop up huge portions of tokens and reap a much higher percentage of reflections as opposed to smaller holders. One, could buy more and out-quantity them but we are tired of those dick swinging whales! Because CORSO tokens will be distributed more smoothly and more fairly it improves returns for holders later in the game.
	 Of course, early adoption MUST and, trust me it does, come with some preferencial treatment. Be it in the form of additional tokens and/or a future airdrop or perhaps an NFT release, there are incentives as always to be one of the first. This is as fair a launch as it gets when it comes to reflection based tokens as previous models have been deemed ponzi-nomics, well that stops here!

CANE  COIN
Our Governance system is an experimental automatic liquidity provision token with governance functions and reflection attributes. An increased liquidity base fee has been introduced to strengthen the price floor more efficiently from an earlier stage than CORSO, presumably will have. We reflect the standard 2% of trade tax back to holders and a further 6% directly into the liquidity pool, this is still a lower trade tax than most tokens with similar attributes. However, not any with a plan like we have.
The contract allows for the delegation of voting power to addresses other than your own. This allows for community members to build a rapport and become trusted within the CorsoCounty community. As per our roadmap, we intend on offering a permanent seat at the table to X amount of community members to fulfill roles within the project.
These people will deliver content for events, competitions scheduled by us and we will collate all entries over all competitions and will allow our holders to vote through governance for which member of the community they feel would best compliment our goals and provide the most value, in YOUR eyes as a community member. (The approach may be revisited but this is a primary goal of ours!)
It also allows for the eventual transition into a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). This is true renouncement of ownership and gives 100% control of the entire County to the community via governance! In order to get there, we must build the walls that'll surround this County!

CorsoCounty Governance Token Farming
CANE will be farmed from our primary staking protocol Molossus. It will require the manual staking and lock-up of CORSO in order in order to distribute your allocated yield for the duration spent staking. In order to receive CANE, it will be offered as a yield offering from Molossus and we will introduce a set few pools and allow for additions to be made based on governance proposals.
Molossus
This is our bread and butter heading into the future! Using Molossus opens up many various avenues for us to explore, we aren't going to reveal them all right now! But one or two that have been discussed has been the idea of our own launchpad, but we want to see something more innovative. Perhaps borrowing/lending faculties? nope. Initially, we'll use this big boy to mint our Governance Tokens from a selection of pools to farm. Evolving to match our future design goals for the eco-system. 

Long-term 

At the far end of the design plan Molossus will house two very special pools, one backed a real-world physical "assest". I use quotations deliberately and with cause because it's not really an assest, and that's as clear as I can be with that for the time being. The 2nd pool will be the catalyst that the first pool needs in order to fulfill the goals of the first pool for each of it's participants. Participants of the first pool are sometimes brought into it without knowing and but always know when they've left the pool. Pool 1 will contain our own synthetic assest that we'll call CC for now and also BNB. This pool will be added to only by approved signatories after off-chain client acquisition, terms negotatied and approval from respective authorities. Pool 1 liquidity is then utilised by a series of protocols much like yield aggregators. Returning a predetermined amount to "client" usually no more than > 1% of initial "assest" value over a predetermined amount.

I know 1%, I sound like your bank. Acquisition will be witnessed in two forms, via our personal action of bringing in additional "clients" and we eventually can be contacted with requests. However, we will vet all requests to become a "client" with us, thoroughly and at length. all of this when the time is right will be announced with a lot more detail and explanation but discretition is key for the time being so I'll leave it at it for now.

But, what I will say is that when I, we, first got into 'crypto' many years ago it had that Mr Robot vibe. Wherein, the purpose of it all was to beat the man, become debt free, become bankless, take the wealth of the 1% and redistribute it to the 99%. Initially it was and for a long time too although that feeling has mostly gone we are optimistic that it's not. Most are in it for the money, and those that are in it for the tech, are building for those with the money! So who is helping the little man now? We are.
