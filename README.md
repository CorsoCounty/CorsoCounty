The core contracts for the BEGINNING of the CorsoCounty long term goals.

 // In 370 BC an ancient Greek kingdom existed, The Kingdom of the Molossians.
 // Their dogs, a Molossus(since extinct), were famous throughout the ancient world for their build and ferocity.
 // The Molossians even issued their native currency with a Molossus stamped into the silver. A literal Molossus Coin.
 // The Molossians were killed and ensalved to Rome after siding with the wrong force and losing the war around 168 BC. Since extinct, you might say.

 // Decended from the Molossus is the Cane Corso. A protectorate of the people, a loyal companion and a law enforcing breed! It is an unequalled protectors of their "owners" and their "property"!

	We are the above, personified.

// Our owners, are you, the hodler. We will lawfully and loyaly protect our users wealth, health and peace of mind.

// Our property, is your funds but not only that. Your finacial growth as an individual isn't something you can hold in your hand or know in your heart.

// We aim to spin that statement on it's head, where you can know in your heart that each: user safety and financial growth can not only be explained but actually proved.
// And that financial growth is something that can and will be materialised and your wealth will be a direct representor of that statement!



	One must walk the dog before it can do it's business, so to speak.
